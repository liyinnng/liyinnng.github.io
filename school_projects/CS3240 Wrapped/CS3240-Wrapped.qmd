## Final thoughts 
First of all, I would like to express my greatest, deepest gratitude to the one and only [Prof B](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bimleshw/?originalSubdomain=sg), who has not only been ***the*** most supportive prof, but also always being so enthusiastic and willing to teach us! I'm really glad that I took your class to mark the start of my UI/UX journey. I would also like to thank our group mentor, Melanie, for her very kind guidance this semester.
