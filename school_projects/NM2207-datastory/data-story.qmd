# About
This project aims to find stories in data through visualization via shiny, ggplot2 and other functions with Rstudio. 

## Topic:
Investigating the relationship between social media usage and its dark side.

***Background***
As social media usage continues to expand globally, there is a growing worry about its impact on the mental and overall health of individuals and communities. A survey conducted by the [Cybersmile Foundation](https://www.marketingtechnews.net/news/2022/jun/22/89-of-people-feel-social-media-negatively-affects-their-mental-health/) reveals that a significant 89% of social media users perceive social media as harmful to their mental well-being. [According Ms Ranjini Veerappan](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/big-read-teenagers-social-media-addiction-cost-mental-health-3647121), a certified addiction specialist at Holistic Psychotherapy Centre, a child's brain is still maturing and rapidly developing until they are about 25 years old. This leads to the prevalence of negative effects of social media within youths.
