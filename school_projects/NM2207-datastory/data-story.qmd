# About
This project aims to find stories in data through visualization via shiny, ggplot2 and other functions with Rstudio.

social_media_health <- read.csv("social-media-and-mental-health.csv")

# Filter age outliers
social_media_health <- social_media_health %>%
  filter(X1..What.is.your.age. != 91)

```

# Analysis 

## Social Media Usage

*Social Media Usage by Age*\
This graphs shows that of all respondents, most of them in their tens to twenties uses social media.

```{r, out.width='100%', eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Data filtering to find rs between age and usage of social media

age_usage_count <- social_media_health %>%
  group_by(X1..What.is.your.age., X6..Do.you.use.social.media.) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggplot(age_usage_count, aes(x = X1..What.is.your.age., y = count, fill = factor(X6..Do.you.use.social.media.))) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Social Media Usage by Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Do you use social media?") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "black", "Yes" = "#FACA5E"))
```

*Average time spent on social media daily*\
Next, we investigate the average time spent on social media daily. The graph indicates that the largest group of respondents spends more than 5 hours of their time on social media daily on average.

```{r, eval=T,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Average time spent on social media daily
social_media <- social_media_health %>% filter( X6..Do.you.use.social.media. == "Yes")

time_spent <- social_media %>% 
  group_by(X8..What.is.the.average.time.you.spend.on.social.media.every.day.) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

time_colour <- "#9FC0DE"

average_time <- plot_ly(
  data = time_spent,
  x = ~X8..What.is.the.average.time.you.spend.on.social.media.every.day.,
  y = ~count,
  type = "bar",
  marker = list(color = time_colour)
)

average_time <- average_time %>%
  layout(
    title = "Average Time Spent on Social Media",
    xaxis = list(title = "Average Time Spent"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Count")
  )


average_time

## Impacts of Social Media 

To investigate on the impacts of social media on various variables, such as one's sleep quality, concentration ability, and worries, the interactive shiny app below that uses a 2-dimensional heat map will be able provide us further insights. 

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}

[Sleep Quality]{.panel-name}

#### Relationship between social media usage and sleep quality:  

- From the heat map, it is evident that those who do not use social media never, or seldom face issues with regards to sleeping as the respondents generally chose between 1 and 2 only. 

- On the other hand, as we move over to the heat map for those who use social media, the darkest area of the heat map is at the top (where respondents chose 5 as their response). 

As we hover over the heat map, a total of 110 and 124 respondents chose 4 and 5 respectively in response to the survey question of "On the scale of 1 to 5, how often do you face issues regarding sleep". The largest group of respondents who use social media indicated that they often face such issues.

:::

::: {.panel}

[Concentration Ability]{.panel-name}

#### Relationship between social media usage and it potential effect on concentration ability:

A similar trend can be observed for the plot comparing the concentration ability of both groups, as compared to the sleep quality section earlier. 

- The plot has an *inverse* relationship between both graphs: Most who do not use social media indicated that they face minimal difficulty in concentrating on things; 

- On the other hand, the plot is thicker at the top for those who use social media, indicating that they face greater difficulty in concentrating on things.

:::

::: {.panel}

[Worries]{.panel-name}

#### Relationship between social media usage and its potential effect of causing worries to users: 

- Starting on the side for those who do not use social media, respondents have only selected "1" and "2", which indicates that they are not at all, to very minimally bothered by worries. 

- On the other hand, the color of the heatmap gets darker progressively, which is an indication that for those who use social media, there is an increasing trend of users being bothered by worries.

*Seeking validation from Social Media*\
```{r, eval=T,echo=FALSE}
# Data filtering to find rs between frequency of seeking validation from SM and frequency of feeling depressed or down 

# Create a cross-tabulation of the two variables
validation_depressed_heatmap <- table(social_media_health$X17..How.often.do.you.look.to.seek.validation.from.features.of.social.media., social_media_health$X18..How.often.do.you.feel.depressed.or.down.)

# Create a heatmap using ggplot2
ggplot(data = as.data.frame(validation_depressed_heatmap), aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = Freq)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "How often do you seek validation from social media?",
       y = "How often do you feel depressed or down?",
       fill = "Frequency") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "#9FC0DE") +
  theme_minimal()
