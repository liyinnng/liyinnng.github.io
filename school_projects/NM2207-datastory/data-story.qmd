# Analysis

## Social Media Usage

We will first start off with analysing the usage of social media among our respondents from the dataset. Starting off with our Pie Chart in the first tab, it is evident that most of the respondents from our data set uses social media.

To further breakdown on our demographics, the Bar Chart in our second tab categorises our respondents and their social media usage tendency according to their ages. From the bars, a similar conclusion can be drawn: most of our respondents are in their 20s, and they do use social media.

::: panel-tabset
## Pie Chart

```{r, out.width='100%', eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}

social_media_use <- social_media_health %>%
  count(X6..Do.you.use.social.media.)

# Define custom colors
color_yes <- "#9FC0DE"
color_no <- "black"

pie <- social_media_use %>% 
  e_charts(x = X6..Do.you.use.social.media.) %>% 
  e_pie(n, legend = FALSE, name = "Do you use social media?") %>% 
  e_tooltip() %>%
  e_color(color = list(color_no, color_yes)) %>% 
  e_title("Do you use social media?")
pie
```

## Bar Chart

```{r, out.width='100%', eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Define custom colors
color_yes <- "#9FC0DE"
color_no <- "black"

social_media_usage <- social_media_health %>%
  count(X1..What.is.your.age., X6..Do.you.use.social.media.) %>%
  spread(X6..Do.you.use.social.media., n, fill = 0)

social_media_usage %>%
  e_charts(X1..What.is.your.age., stack = "grp") %>%
  e_bar(Yes, name = "Use Social Media", stack = "stack", barWidth = 10, 
        itemStyle = list(color = color_yes)) %>% 
  e_bar(No, name = "Do Not Use Social Media", stack = "stack", barWidth = 10, 
        itemStyle = list(color = color_no)) %>%

**Average time spent on social media daily**\
Next, we investigate the average time spent on social media daily by our respondents. The graph indicates that the largest group of respondents spends more than 5 hours of their time on social media daily on average. This is an extremely concerning phenomenon as a study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania in 2018 revealed that daily social media usage that exceeds 30 minutes led to heightened anxiety, depression, feelings of loneliness, sleep disturbances, and the fear of missing out (FOMO).<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> 

```{r, eval=T,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Average time spent on social media daily

time_colour <- "#9FC0DE"

time_spent <- social_media_health %>%
  filter( X6..Do.you.use.social.media. == "Yes") %>%
  filter(!is.na(X8..What.is.the.average.time.you.spend.on.social.media.every.day.)) %>%
  group_by(X8..What.is.the.average.time.you.spend.on.social.media.every.day.) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(count))

# Create echarts4r bar chart
time_spent %>%
  e_charts(X8..What.is.the.average.time.you.spend.on.social.media.every.day.) %>%
  e_bar(count, 
        itemStyle = list(color = time_colour),
        barWidth = 100,
        barCategoryGap = "10%",  
        barGap = "5%") %>%
  e_tooltip(
    trigger = "axis", 
    axisPointer = list(
      type = "shadow"
      )
    ) %>%
  e_y_axis(
    splitArea = list(show = FALSE),
    splitLine = list(show = FALSE),
    name = "Count",
    axisLabel = list(fontSize = 12)
  ) %>%
  e_x_axis(
    boundaryGap = c(0, 0.5),
    name = "Average Time Spent on Social Media",
    axisLabel = list(
      fontSize = 12,
      rotate = 0,
      interval = 0,
      formatter = htmlwidgets::JS(
        "function(value) {
          return echarts.format.truncateText(value, 100, '...', '14px Microsoft Yahei', '…');
        }"
      )
    )
  ) %>%

## Impacts of Social Media

To investigate on the impacts of social media on various variables, such as one's sleep quality, concentration ability, and worries, the interactive shiny app below that uses a 2-dimensional heat map will be able provide us further insights.

::: panel-tabset
## Sleep Quality

#### Relationship between social media usage and sleep quality:

-   From the heat map, it is evident that those who do not use social media never, or seldom face issues with regards to sleeping as the respondents generally chose between 1 and 2 only.

-   On the other hand, as we move over to the heat map for those who use social media, the darkest area of the heat map is at the top (where respondents chose 5 as their response).

As we hover over the heat map, a total of 110 and 124 respondents chose 4 and 5 respectively in response to the survey question of "On the scale of 1 to 5, how often do you face issues regarding sleep". The largest group of respondents who use social media indicated that they often face such issues.

## Concentration Ability

#### Relationship between social media usage and it potential effect on concentration ability:

A similar trend can be observed for the plot comparing the concentration ability of both groups, as compared to the sleep quality section earlier.

-   The plot has an *inverse* relationship between both graphs: Most who do not use social media indicated that they face minimal difficulty in concentrating on things;

-   On the other hand, the plot is thicker at the top for those who use social media, indicating that they face greater difficulty in concentrating on things.

## Worries

#### Relationship between social media usage and its potential effect of causing worries to users:

-   Starting on the side for those who do not use social media, respondents have only selected "1" and "2", which indicates that they are not at all, to very minimally bothered by worries.

-   On the other hand, the color of the heatmap gets darker progressively, which is an indication that for those who use social media, there is an increasing trend of users being bothered by worries.

#### Seeking validation & feeling depressed:

*Seeking validation from social media*

Plotting a heat map to observe the relationship between the frequency of seeking validation from Social Media, and the frequency of feeling depressed or down, these are some notable trends:

-   Those who do not seek validation from social media also rarely feel depressed or down

-   On the other hand, out of those who seek validation from social media very often (those who indicated 5 to that question), the largest group of them indicated that they often feel depressed or down.

```{r, eval=T,echo=FALSE}
# Data filtering to find rs between frequency of seeking validation from SM and frequency of feeling depressed or down 

# Create a cross-tabulation of the two variables
validation_depressed_heatmap <- table(social_media_health$X17..How.often.do.you.look.to.seek.validation.from.features.of.social.media., social_media_health$X18..How.often.do.you.feel.depressed.or.down.)

heatmap_data <- as.data.frame(validation_depressed_heatmap)

heatmap_data |>
  e_chart(Var1) |>
  e_visual_map(Freq) |>
  e_heatmap(Var2, Freq) |>
  e_title("Validation and Depression Heatmap") |>
  e_theme("macarons2") |>
  e_x_axis(name = "How often do you seek validation from SM?") |>
  e_y_axis(name = "How often do you feel depressed or down?")|>
  e_grid(left = "15%", right = "32%")

```

#### Comparison with others on Social Media

*Frequency in comparing oneself to other successful people through the use of social media, and how one feels about these comparisons generally speaking*

::: panel-tabset

## Dataset Mutation
<p>From the data set, I created a new column, age_group to separate the respondents into different age groups as seen from the drop down menu based on the respective age range the respondents fall into to further analyse the impact of one's age.  While those who are under 16 years old are usually considered as a "Child", I have expanded the age range to below "25" accordingly since it is the age range where they are more susceptible to being negatively affected by social media as mentioned earlier<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

## Comparison Frequency 
Selecting the "All ages" option, it can be observed that while there are more respondents who seldom compare themselves to other successful people through social media then those who compare frequently, there are still a handful of respondents who do compare themselves frequently.

* As we click into the various age groups, it appears that the majority of respondents who very frequently compare themselves ("5") to other successful people fall under the "Child" age group.

## Comparison Feelings
On the other hand, as we click into the comparison feelings, while it appears that most are neutral towards these comparisons, it can be observed that there is still a significant amount of respondents who have negative feelings towards these comparisons. In fact, there are more who noted that they are negatively affected by these comparisons ("1" & "2"), as compared to those who feel good from these comparisons ("4" and "5")

* As we click into the various age groups once again, specifically those who fall under the "Child" category, the majority of them indicated to be neutral towards these comparisons ("3"). However, it can also be observed that there are more respondents in this age group that indicated that they felt bad after these comparisons ("1" & "2") as compared to feeling good ("4" & "5"). Hence this does support the research and studies mentioned earlier. 

:::

<sub> **notes**:\
1 indicates seldom compare, and 5 indicates compare very frequently for *comparison frequency*;\
1 indicates feels bad, and 5 indicates feels good for *feelings towards the comparisons*;\
Clicking on either of the legend at the top will remove the plot respectively </sub>

## Top Hate Words

::: panel-tabset

## Observations

From another data set<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup>, I decided to create a Word Cloud with *Shiny* to find out more about the words that are most used when people are posting comments that are considered as being hateful. The Word Cloud highlights the predominant themes associated with hateful comments, such as those related to gender, race, and religion. With more using the social media, it is important that users are more mindful of what they post online to contribute to a healthy digital environment that promotes understanding, empathy, and constructive dialoague. 

## Shiny

From the data set, there are way too many unique words used, and it is impossible to fit all of them in the word cloud. Hence I included a reactive slider to limit the number of words to be included in the word cloud. I also specifically removed some of the most used words such as "that", "like", etc... that are very obviously words that are hateful.

# Conclusion


In conclusion, the impact of social media on its users is undeniably complex, encompassing both positive and negative aspects. While the negative effects are particularly pronounced for children, given their heightened susceptibility to external influences, it is crucial to recognize that social media has also introduced numerous benefits into our lives.

However, the narrative takes a distinct turn when considering children, who may lack the cognitive maturity to navigate the online world responsibly. In this context, social media companies bear a significant responsibility to carefully curate content and consider the potential impact on young, impressionable minds. Striking a balance between fostering a positive online environment and protecting the well-being of children requires a collective effort from parents, educators, and the platforms themselves.

As we navigate the intricate landscape of social media, there is a need for conscientious use, regardless of age. Education on digital literacy, responsible online behavior, and age-appropriate content consumption should be prioritized. By fostering a culture of mindfulness and responsible digital citizenship, we can harness the positive aspects of social media while mitigating its potential adverse effects, particularly for the younger members of our society.
