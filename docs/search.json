Albeit university life can be taxing (with all the never-ending assignments, quizzes, and project…), I allow myself to unwind and relax through things that I take interest in.\nI enjoy gaming, journalling, and doodling. The logo I am currently using is designed myself when I first started experimenting with Procreate. In addition, I also think that it is important to avoid leading a sedentary lifestyle, hence dancing is also one of my hobby. Just a fun fact about myself, I’ve been doing ballet since I was three, and I still enjoy this genre of dance very much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy logo."
