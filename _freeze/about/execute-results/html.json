As I was introduced to the world of coding a tad later than my peers, I was really apprehensive towards this field. But thankfully I was surrounded by some really supportive professors/instructors and peers who gave me immense help to make up for being a 'laggard'.\n\nWith that being said, I am also a good team player who's not afraid to experiment with fresh things. I really believe in the importance of being an eager self-directed learner, hence and I enjoy gaining new knowledge along the way.\n\n## {{< fa smile >}} Hobbies.\n\nI feel very fortunate to have the ability to indulge in many of the things that i love *a lot* now. Albeit university life can be taxing (with all the never-ending assignments, quizzes, and project...), I allow myself to unwind and relax through things that I take interest in.\n\nI enjoy gaming, journaling, and doodling. The logo I am currently using is designed myself when I first started experimenting with Procreate.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/logo.png){width=539}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.extra-small-text .dark-gray-text .topbr}\nMy logo.\n:::\n:::\n",
