From Instagram stories to illustrated grid layouts from scratch, these designs attracted over 600 sign ups for the camp. \n\n\n---\nformat: html\nfilters:\n   - lightbox\nlightbox: auto\n---\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimg_files <- fs::dir_ls(\"images\", glob=\"*.jpg\")\ncat(\"::: {layout-ncol=2}\\n\",\n    glue::glue(\"![]({img_files})\\n\\n\\n\"),\n    \":::\",\n    sep = \"\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-08-57.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-19.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-23.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-26.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-28.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-31.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-33.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-38.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-41.jpg)\n\n![](images/photo_2024-04-15_17-10-53.jpg)\n\n:::\n",
